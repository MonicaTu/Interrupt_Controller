===============================================================================

    This is a simple 8 input interrupt controller.
    Written in verilog.

    Currently it supports two modes, polling and custom priority.
    In polling, source 0 has highest priority and 7 the lowest.
    In the custom priority mode, the priorities are set during the
    initialization phase. The controller then polls the sources in
    this custom order.

    More details and a comprehensive testbench to follow.
